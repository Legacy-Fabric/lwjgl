The Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) is a solution aimed directly at professional and amateur Java programmers alike to enable commercial quality games to be written in Java. 
LWJGL provides developers access to high performance cross-platform libraries such as OpenGL (Open Graphics Library), OpenCL (Open Computing Language) and OpenAL (Open Audio Library) allowing for state of the art 3D games and 3D sound.
Additionally, LWJGL provides access to controllers such as Game-pads, Steering wheel and Joysticks.
All in a simple and straight forward API.
